        The match was heating up. The crowd roared with anticipation as the ball was passed from player to player, the energy in the air crackling like static. Yisang, wearing his team's kit, stood poised near the edge of the penalty box, eyes locked on the ball. His expression was cool, calculating—his focus absolute. On the field, everything around him seemed to fade. It was just him and the game.

His teammates were in perfect sync, moving as one, with the opposing defenders closing in. The ball was sent spiraling toward him from the wing, a perfectly timed cross that sliced through the air with pinpoint accuracy. Yisang's body shifted into motion as if he had already anticipated this moment before it even happened.

His first touch was a thing of precision. The ball dropped gently onto his foot, and he didn’t waste a second. In a smooth motion, his foot connected with the ball, sending it flying with a velocity that left the goalkeeper with little time to react. The goalkeeper lunged, arms outstretched, but it was no use. The ball slammed into the top corner of the net, just out of reach.

The stadium erupted in cheers, but Yisang—true to form—didn’t let himself be swept away by the celebration. He stood for a brief moment, gazing at the ball in the net, as if assessing the success of the move with the same detached precision he applied to everything. A small, almost imperceptible smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth as he nodded slightly—acknowledging that it was exactly what he had planned.

His teammates mobbed him, their faces lit up with excitement, but Yisang merely gave a short, confident nod, his focus already shifting to the next phase of the game. In his eyes, scoring a goal was simply another task completed, another challenge overcome.

        An interview with yisang
        <br><br><br>
    Yisang: "I want to reach 1,000 goals," said the star of the city, estimating that the historic mark could come around the age of 31.<br>
    "If I don't have any injuries, this for me is the most important thing, I want that.<br>
    For me, the best mark that I can have in football is to reach, first, 900 goals.<br>
     After, my challenge is to be at 1,000 goals.<br>
    "When you have passion for what you're doing, you cannot be worried about how you're feeling," he said.<br>
    "I failed because I've made pressure for myself since I was 11 years old. <br>
    'yisang, you are the best player in the world,' I'm always thinking in that way.
